For these notes am using my raspberry PI 
You can use any VM / server from the hosting service (AWS) / your old PC

How to access : 

Simple method use tor Browser / Brave with tor new tab opened

Why DW is called anonymous :

#random three onion relay or simply routing through different node Among 7500 node actively available as recent research says 
Then it'll choose any one of 3 introduction point that given to the website randomly, it'll form an onion circuit and pass a password phase
With the new point of meeting relay circuit, this happens on the client side

#From the server-side DW has a Distributed hash table in that all the .onion domains are stored and it's Stored with their randomly chosen introduction points 
the first step will be the onion service descriptor verify the public key(Domain name) and give the introduction node to the client 
The client sends the new place where the client will wait for the website files to be received with a password this server will send the data
Through random circuit to the client once both the pass phase matches then he'll establish a connection with the site because of these many random 
Circuit, random routing on both the server and client-side that's the reason it's not easy for you to know from where the website is hosted same 
Applies to the site for it to know where are you from ðŸ˜…

Host your website on DW

#Am using Raspberry Pi

after installing Raspberry pi go setup the sudo account and password go to terminal
sudo apt update /update the repo 
sudo apt install tor / installing tot
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc    //"remove the "#" for hiddenservicedir and hiiddenserviceport
save the file
Stop and restart the service
sudo service tor stop /command to stop 
sudo service tor start /command to start
sudo service tor status /command to check the status
check for green and active
to get the onion address
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname /provide you the .onion URL
cope the onion URL 
install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx
sudo service nginx start 
sudo service nginx status
copy-paste the website URL 
done now ur site is live
Additional configuration :
sudo nano /etc/nginx.conf
